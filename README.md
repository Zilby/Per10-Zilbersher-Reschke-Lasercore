Lasercore
=======

This project is so far designed to be a hexagon-style game in which the player dodges obstacles shot at them by three 'round' bumpers while positioned upon a semicircle AKA: the ball. There will also be a limited number of lasers at the player's disposal to shoot obstacles out of the way. The bumpers will shoot in time to the music, and the player, ball and bumpers will also glow in time with the music. 

The name itself is derived from the in-game lasers and the laser-electronic inspired music being the 'core' of the gameplay.

So far: 

-Menu background created 

-Menu music added

-Names and title fade in after a delay 

-'Press Space' fades in and out

-framework set in place
